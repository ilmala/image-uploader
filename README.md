<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview

![screenshot](screenshot1.png)

You can see the demo of my project [here](https://devchallenges-image-uploader.herokuapp.com/).

Even though the project was very simple, I learned how to:
- Use drop action with VueJs.
- Trigger select file from a button.
- Handle state in a single Vue Component.
- Handle Upload file with Laravel on Heroku.

Thanks to Laravel, the upload process took just over 5 lines of code ... impressive!
